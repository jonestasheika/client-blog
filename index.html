         <h1>Girls Super Hero</h1>
         <br>
         <p>Women - and female superheroes in particular - haven’t always been treated well in the world of comics. For every genuinely strong, well-rounded character, it seems like three vacuous, self-obsessed damsels-in-distress pop up and ruin any sort of progress. For years, women were largely relegated to one of three roles in comic books: the victim, the blonde bombshell, or the villain.That being said, there are a few characters who managed to transcend the litany of backwards, female-centric comic book tropes. During the Golden Age of comics, a few superheroines managed to break free of the near-universal typecasting and became something more - actual, well-developed characters with strengths, weaknesses, and personalities that extended past boys and shopping.</p>
         Sure, not every character has aged particularly well, and there are still aspects of their individual stories that are clearly products of a bygone era, but the following superheroines still deserve credit for helping push the role of women in comics forward. These are the 15 First Female Comic Book Superheroes In History.This fall sees the premiere of two highly anticipated female-centric superhero shows, the feminist-leaning Supergirl (which flew onto CBS last week with stellar ratings) and the sexually nuanced Marvel’s Jessica Jones (November 20, Netflix). The sad truth is, one of the reasons they’re both such welcome additions to fall’s new lineup stems from the tired yet irrefutable fact that the number of robust women superheroes anchoring onscreen plotlines remains criminally low. But, it’s not totally hopeless — there has been a small handful of fabulous, forceful portrayals that paved the way for Melissa Benoist’s Kara Zor-El and Krysten Ritter’s Jessica Jones, who in a perfect world will usher in even more nuanced heroines.Over the nearly 50 years’ worth of TV and movies covered here, female superheroes have fought an ongoing battle against one-dimensional representation, lack of backstory, underdeveloped personae, and relegation to eye-candy status. As these women have knocked down barrier after barrier (both literally and figuratively), they’ve kicked the damsel-in-distress label to the curb in favor of more complex portrayals. At the same time, these added facets bring out a real humanity in characters who for decades were just supposed to take down the bad guy without any acknowledgment of the psychological damage that might accompany that. With this level of empowerment and growing equality comes a new layer of purpose, especially if the character in question is the protagonist in her own show or film.</p>
